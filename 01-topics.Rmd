**Unit 1 - Exploring data: ** This unit focuses on data visualization and data 
wrangling. Specifically we cover fundamentals of data and data visualization, 
confounding variables, and Simpson's paradox as well as the concept of tidy 
data, data import, data cleaning, and data curation. We end the unit with web 
scraping and introduce the idea of iteration in preparation for the next unit. 
Also in this unit students are introduced to the toolkit: R, RStudio, R Markdown, 
Git, and GitHub.

**Unit 2 - Making rigorous conclusions:** In this part we introduce modelling and 
statistical inference for making data-based conclusions. We discuss building, 
interpreting, and selecting models, visualizing interaction effects, and 
prediction and model validation. Statistical inference is introduced from a 
simulation based perspective, and the Central Limit Theorem is discussed very 
briefly to lay the foundation for future coursework in statistics. 

**Unit 3 - Looking forward:** In the last unit we present a series of modules
such as interactive reporting and visualization with Shiny, text analysis, and 
Bayesian inference. These are independent modules that educators can choose to 
include in their introductory data science curriculum depending on how much time 
they have left in the semester.

<br>

The table below outlines a sample course schedule developed for a 15-week long 
semester course that meets twice a week for lecture and once a week for a 
computing lab. Our recommendation for shorter semesters or 10-week quarters would 
be to skip hypothesis testing and inference beyond bootstrapping (we believe 
that it's important to touch on quantifying uncertainty even if you don't have 
time to cover statistical inference deeply) and also top skip any topics in the 
looking further unit other than data science ethics (we believe that this is an 
essential topic to cover both throughout the class and also as at least one 
dedicated session).

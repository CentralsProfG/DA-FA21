# Sharing {#sharing}

A nifty tool for building your course website is blogdown.

Perhaps the most useful aspect of blogdown in this setting is that your slides, assignments, etc. written in R Markdown can be automatically rendered, so you donâ€™t need to separate knit those documents.

More instructions on this are forthcoming, but for the time being, you can use [this course website](http://introds.org/) as an example, source code [here](https://github.com/ids-s1-19/website).

[This webinar](https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars/sharing-on-short-notice-how-to-get-your-materials-online-with-r-markdown) is also very useful for options for sharing your course materials with students.
